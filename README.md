## üé® Customization

### Brand Colors

Update the color palette in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
extend: {
  colors: {
    primary: '#0B1F3B',    // Navy - main brand color
    secondary: '#334155',   // Slate - secondary text
    accent: '#CBA135',      // Gold - highlights and CTAs

    text: '#0F172A',       // Dark - primary text
    muted: '#475569',      // Gray - secondary text
  }
}
```

### Typography

The site uses two font families:
- **Inter**: For UI elements and body text
- **Merriweather**: For headings and emphasis

Fonts are loaded via Google Fonts in `src/index.css`.

### University Information

Update university-specific content in:
- **Header**: `src/components/Header.tsx` - University name and navigation
- **Hero**: `src/sections/Hero.tsx` - Main value proposition and messaging
- **Footer**: `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Contact information and links
- **Programs**: `src/sections/Programs.tsx` - Academic programs and descriptions
- **Scholarships**: `src/sections/Scholarships.tsx` - Financial aid programs and amounts
- **Contact**: `src/sections/Contact.tsx` - University contact information and departments

### Scholarship Programs

Customize scholarship information in `src/sections/Scholarships.tsx`:

```javascript
const scholarships = [
  {
    title: 'Merit Excellence Scholarship',
    amount: 'Up to $25,000',
    description: 'Outstanding academic achievements and leadership potential',
    requirements: ['GPA 3.8+', 'SAT 1400+/ACT 32+', 'Leadership', 'Community service'],
    deadline: 'March 1st',
    renewable: true
  }
  // Add more scholarships...
];
```

### Contact Information

Update contact details in `src/sections/Contact.tsx`:

```javascript
const contactInfo = [
  {
    title: 'Visit Our Campus',
    details: ['123 University Avenue', 'Education City, State 12345'],
    action: 'Get Directions'
  }
  // Update with your university's information...
];

const departments = [
  { name: 'Admissions Office', email: 'admissions@youruniversity.edu', phone: '+1 (555) 123-4568' },
  // Add more departments...
];
```

### Form Configuration

Customize the contact form in `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`:

```typescript
interface FormData {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  interest: string;
  message: string;
}

const interests = [
  'Undergraduate Programs',
  'Graduate Programs',
  'Online Learning',
  // Add more interest categories...
];
```
### Images

The application uses Pexels for professional photography:

1. **With Pexels API** (Recommended):
   - Set `VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
   - Images are fetched automatically based on search queries

2. **Without API Key** (Fallback):
   - Placeholder images are used from the `PLACEHOLDER_IMAGES` constant
   - Update URLs in `src/lib/pexels.ts` to use your own images
